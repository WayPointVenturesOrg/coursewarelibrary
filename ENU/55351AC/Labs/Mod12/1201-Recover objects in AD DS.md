# Lab: Recover objects in AD DS

## Lab scenario

it's your responsibility to ensure that the directory service is backed up. Today, you notice that last night's backup didn't run as scheduled. You therefore decide to perform an interactive backup. Shortly after the backup, a domain administrator accidentally deletes the IT organizational unit (OU) and the user accounts contained in the OU. You must recover this OU and its associated user accounts.

## Exercise 1: Back up and restore AD DS

### Scenario
