# Lab: Domain and trust management in AD DS

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation has deployed a single Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain with all domain controllers (DCs) located in its London datacenter. As the company has grown and added branch offices with a large numbers of users, it's become increasingly apparent that the current AD DS environment doesn't meet company requirements. The network team is concerned about the amount of AD DS–related network traffic that is crossing wide area network (WAN) links, which are becoming highly utilized.

The company has also become increasingly integrated with partner organizations, some of which need access to shared resources and applications that are located on the Contoso internal network. The Security department at Contoso wants to ensure that access for these external users is as secure as possible. 

As one of Contoso's senior network administrators, you're responsible for implementing an AD DS infrastructure that meets company requirements and for planning an AD DS domain and forest deployment that provides optimal services for internal and external users while maintaining security requirements.

## Exercise 1: Implement forest trusts

### Scenario

Contoso Corporation is working on several projects with a partner organization named Trey Research. To simplify enabling access to resources in the two organizations, they've deployed a WAN between London and Munich, where Trey Research is located. You now must implement and validate a forest trust between the two forests and configure the trust to allow access to only selected servers in London.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure stub zones for Domain Name System (DNS) name resolution.

2. Configure a forest trust with selective authentication.

3. Configure a server for selective authentication.
