# Lab: Manage user settings with Group Policy

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation has deployed Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2021 to users, and you need to use Group Policy to configure and apply settings for some Microsoft Office apps. The IT department uses logon scripts to provide users with drive mapping to shared folders. However, maintaining these scripts is an ongoing problem, because they're large and complex. You decide to use Group Policy preferences to implement drive mapping, which removes reliance on logon scripts.

Your manager also has asked that you place a desktop shortcut to the Notepad app for all users who belong to the IT Security group. Additionally, you must add a new computer administrator’s security group as a local administrator on all servers.

Finally, to help minimize profile sizes, you need to configure Folder Redirection to redirect several profile folders to each user’s home drive.

## Exercise 1: Use administrative templates to manage user settings

### Scenario

To use Group Policy for configuring Microsoft Office settings, you need to first import custom administrative templates.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Import administrative templates for Microsoft Office.

2. Configure Office settings.

3. Apply and verify settings on the client computer.
