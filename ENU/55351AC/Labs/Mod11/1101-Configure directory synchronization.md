# Lab: Configure directory synchronization

## Lab scenario

As part of the proof-of-concept phase, your team must configure and test synchronization between on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Microsoft Entra ID. You must prepare AD DS for directory synchronization, install and run the Microsoft Entra Connect tool (previously known as Azure AD Connect), and then verify directory synchronization.

>**NOTE:** This lab requires that students provision an Office 365 trial tenant. Microsoft requires credit card verification during the trial tenant provisioning. No charges will be applied if recurring billing is disabled and the payment method is removed, as instructed in the lab steps. Students who don't have a credit card, can use the Microsoft 365 Developer program to apply for trial. More details are available at: [Developer Program | Microsoft 365 Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
## Exercise 1: Prepare for directory synchronization

### Scenario

Before you configure directory synchronization, you must create and prepare your Microsoft Entra tenant. In this exercise, you'll create the required accounts and create a new Microsoft Entra tenant by provisioning the Office 365 E5 trial subscription.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a trial Office 365 E5 subscription.

2. Verify the Microsoft Entra tenant, and (optionally) add a domain.

### Task 1: Create a trial Office 365 E5 subscription

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  From the taskbar, select to open **Microsoft Edge**.

3.  In the address bar, enter the following URL and the press Enter: **`https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-enterprise-e5-business-software`**

4.  Select the **Try for Free** link.

4.  On the **Let's get you started** page, in the **Email** text box, enter an email address in the form of **`mmddyyyourinitials@outlook.com`**, and then select **Next**. (Where mmddyy represents the month, day, and year in two digits.)

>Note: You'll be directed to create a new account.

5.  On the **Let's get you started** page, select **Set up account**.

8.  Retrieve the verification code from your phone, and in the **Enter your verification code** text box, enter the provided code, and then select **Verify**.

9.  On the **How you'll sign in** page, enter the following details, and then select **Next**:

   - Username: Your choice
   - Domain name: **mmddyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com** and click **Save**.
   - Password and Confirm password: **`Pa55w.rd1234`**

10.  On the **Quantity and payment** page, verify that the license quantity is set to **1**. 

>Note: Be sure that you note the trial expiration date in the lower right corner of the window. You will not be charged during the trial period. Ensure that you follow all steps in this task to disable recurring billing on your subscription and remove credit card details before the trial expires. Although you will not be charged until trial expires, it is recommended that you remove your payment details when instructed by lab steps.

11.  Select **Add payment method**.

12.  On the **Add payment method** page, fill in your personal details and your credit card number. Your credit card will not be charged at this moment. It is used for verification purposes. Select **Save** when you are done.

13.  On the **Review and confirm** page, review your details, ensure that you note the date when your trial expires, and select **Start trial**. 

14.  On the **Thanks for choosing Office 365 E5 Trial** page, ensure that you note your username and select **Start using Office 365 E5 Trial**.

15.  On the **Install Microsoft 365** page, at the bottom-right corner, select **Exit setup**. Provide a reason for exiting setup, and then select **Send and exit**.

23.  On the **Review details and delete** page, select **Delete** and then select **Close**.

>Note: Ensure that your credit card is removed from the **Payment methods** page. This is very important to avoid unwanted charges.

### Task 2: Verify the Microsoft Entra tenant and add a custom domain

1.  On **LON-CL1**, in the **Microsoft Edge** window, open a new tab, and then browse to **`https://entra.microsoft.com`**.

2.  Expand **Users** and select **All users**. Ensure that you see your user account.

## Exercise 3: Manage Active Directory users and groups, and validate directory synchronization

### Scenario

Now that directory synchronization is in place and working, you need to identify how managing user and group accounts has changed with directory synchronization.
