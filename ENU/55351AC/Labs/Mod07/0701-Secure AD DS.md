# Lab: Securing AD DS

## Lab scenario

The security team at Contoso Corporation has been examining possible security issues in the organization, focusing on Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). The security team is particularly concerned with AD DS authentication and security of branch-office domain controllers (DCs).

You need to improve security and monitoring of authentication against the enterprise’s AD DS domain. Contoso has instituted a new password policy, and you need to enforce it for all user accounts and develop a more-stringent password policy for security-sensitive administrative accounts. It's also important that you implement an appropriate audit trail to help monitor authentication attempts within AD DS. 

The second part of your assignment includes deploying and configuring read-only domain controllers (RODCs) to support AD DS authentication within a branch office. Lastly, you need to evaluate the usage of a group managed service account (gMSA) by deploying it to the test server.

## Exercise 1: Implement security policies for accounts, passwords, and administrative groups

### Scenario

Contoso management has indicated that it's important that all management processes are as secure as possible, to help prevent a security breach. The company’s security and management teams have identified business requirements with respect to account logons and password security. In this exercise, you'll define and implement the Group Policy settings to meet the company’s requirements.

##### **Contoso GPO strategy proposal: Requirements overview**

Contoso has identified the following requirements regarding account logon and password policies:

- All users must use a password that's at least eight characters long. For IT administrators, the minimum length must be 10 characters.

- Passwords for all users must be complex and stored securely.

- All users, except IT administrators, must change their password every 60 days or less.

- IT administrators must change their password every 30 days or less.

- If users enter the wrong password more than five times within 20 minutes, their accounts must be locked. For normal users, accounts are unlocked automatically after one hour.

- For IT administrators, accounts must be locked after three incorrect password attempts. IT administrator accounts are never unlocked automatically. An administrator must unlock the account. IT administrator accounts include all members of the IT group and the Domain Admins group.

- No users should be able to use at least 10 of their previous passwords.

- The membership list for the local Administrators group on all member servers must be limited to only the local Administrator account, the Domain Admins group, and the IT group.

- The Domain Admins group must include only the Administrator account.

- The Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups must be empty during normal operations. Users must be added explicitly to these groups only when they need to perform tasks that require this level of administrative rights.

- Other built-in groups, such as Account Operators and Server Operators, should contain no members. If users are added to one of these groups, they should be removed from the group automatically.

- All changes made to user objects and security groups in AD DS must be audited.

## Exercise 2: Deploying and configuring an RODC

### Scenario

In this exercise, you'll configure the server **LON-SVR1** as an RODC in the branch office. To avoid travel costs, you decide to do the conversion remotely, working with a desktop-support technician and the branch’s only IT staff member. This user already has installed a Windows Server named **LON-SVR1**. You'll stage a delegated installation of an RODC so that this administrative user can complete the installation. After the deployment is complete, you'll configure a domain-wide password replication policy and the password replication policy specific to **LON-SVR1**.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Stage a delegated installation of an RODC.

2. Run the Active Directory Domain Services Installation Wizard on an RODC to complete the deployment process.

3. Configure the domain-wide password replication policy.

4. Create a group to manage password replication to the branch office RODC.

5. Evaluate the resultant password replication policy.

### Task 1: Stage a delegated installation of an RODC

#### Preparation

To prestage an RODC account, the computer name must not be in use in the domain. Therefore, you first need to remove **LON-SVR1** from the domain by performing the following steps:

### Task 2: Install a group MSA

1.  On **LON-DC1**, at the **Windows PowerShell ISE** command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
Install-ADServiceAccount –Identity Webservice
   ```

2.  In **Server Manager**, select the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

3.  Expand **LON-DC1 (Contoso\\Administrator)**, and then select **Application Pools**.

4.  In the details pane, right-click or access the context menu for the **DefaultAppPool**, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

5.  In the **Advanced Settings** dialog box, in the **Process Model** section, select **Identity**, and then select the **ellipsis** (…).
