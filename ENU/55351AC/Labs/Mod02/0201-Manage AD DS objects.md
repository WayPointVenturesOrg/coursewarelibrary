# Lab A: Manage AD DS objects

## Lab scenario

You are a server support specialist for Contoso Corporation. You've been assigned to help configure the infrastructure for a new branch office for the Research department. To begin the new branch office's deployment, you're preparing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) objects. 

You need to create users and groups for the new Research department branch office and test the ability to reset the secure channel for a branch-office computer account that's lost connectivity to the Contoso.com domain.

## Exercise 1: Create and manage groups in AD DS

### Scenario

You need to create groups for the Research department, and you require a distribution global group to facilitate email delivery to Research users. Carlos Tijerina will manage this group. You will also create a Research Managers group and add Carlos Tijerina and Susan Kemp as members of the group. You also need to create a universal group in the Managers organizational unit (OU) that will contain all the departmental managers’ global groups. After creating the research distribution group, you realize that the group needs access to network resources, so you must convert the group to a security group.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create groups and add members.

2. Configure group nesting.

3. Convert a group type from **Distribution** to **Security**.


### Task 1: Create groups and add members

## Exercise 3: Manage computer objects in AD DS

### Scenario

A user is unable to sign in, and a workstation has lost its connectivity to the domain and can't authenticate users properly. When users attempt to access resources from this workstation, access is denied. You need to repair the trust relationship between the computer and the domain.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

> **Question**: What is the message that displays?
><details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
  > **Answer**: The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed.
</details>

### Task 3: Resolve the computer issue

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.

    >Note:  The Administrator account is able to sign in due to cached credentials.
