# Lab: Implement AD FS

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation has set up a variety of business relationships with other companies that need to access business applications that are running on the Contoso corporate network. Contoso wants to provide maximum level of functionality and access to these companies. The Security and Operations departments want to ensure that business partners and customers can access only the resources for which they have authorization and also that implementing the solution doesn't significantly increase the workload for the Operations team. 

To meet these business requirements, you plan to implement Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). In the initial deployment, you plan to use AD FS to implement single sign-on (SSO) for internal users who are accessing an application on a web server. Contoso Corporation is partnering with another company, Trey Research, and its users should be able to access the same application.

As a proof of concept, you'll deploy a sample claims-aware application and configure AD FS to allow both internal users and Trey Research users to access the same application.

## Exercise 1: Configuring the AD FS prerequisites

### Scenario

To deploy AD FS, you must verify the configuration of all required components. You also need to verify that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is deployed in the organization and configure certificates for the AD FS server and web servers. Lastly, you must configure the Domain Name System (DNS) forwarders to enable communication between Contoso.com and TreyResearch.net.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure the DNS forwarders.

2. Configure the certificate trusts.

3. Configure an SSL certificate for the web server.

### Task 1: Configure the DNS forwarders

1.  Sign in to **LON-DC1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

    > Note: Server Manager starts automatically.

2.  In the **Server Manager** window, select **Tools**, and then select **DNS**.

3.  In **DNS Manager**, expand **LON-DC1**, and then select **Conditional Forwarders**.

4.  Right-click or access the context menu for **Conditional Forwarders**, and then select **New Conditional Forwarder**.

5.  In the **New Conditional Forwarder** window, in the **DNS Domain** box, enter **`TreyResearch.net`**.

6.  In the **IP addresses of the master servers** box, enter **`172.16.10.10`**, and then select Enter.

    > Note: If you receive a notification that the IP address isn't authoritative for the required zone, you can safely ignore and proceed.

7.  Select the **Store this conditional forwarder in Active Directory, and replicate it as follows** check box, select **All DNS servers in this forest**, and then select **OK**.

8.  Close DNS Manager.

9.  Switch to **TREY-DC1**.

10.  Sign in to **TREY-DC1** as **TreyResearch\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

11.  In the **Server Manager** window, select **Tools**, and then select **DNS**.

12.  In **DNS Manager**, expand **TREY-DC1**, and then select **Conditional Forwarders**.

13.  Right-click or access the context menu for **Conditional Forwarders**, and then select **New Conditional Forwarder**.

14.  In the **New Conditional Forwarder** window, in the **DNS Domain** box, enter **`Contoso.com`**.

15.  In the **IP addresses of the master servers** box, enter **`172.16.0.10`**, and then select Enter.

    > Note: If you receive a notification that the IP address isn't authoritative for the required zone, you can safely ignore and proceed.

16.  Select the **Store this conditional forwarder in Active Directory, and replicate it as follows** check box, select **All DNS servers in this forest**, and then select **OK**.

17.  Close DNS Manager.

    > Note: In a real production environment, you'll probably use Internet DNS instead of conditional forwarders.

### Task 2: Configure the certificate trusts

1.  Switch to **LON-DC1**.

2.  On **LON-DC1**, open **File Explorer**, browse to **`\\TREY-DC1\CertEnroll`**, and then copy **TREY-DC1.TreyResearch.net_TreyResearchCA.crt** to **C:\\**.
