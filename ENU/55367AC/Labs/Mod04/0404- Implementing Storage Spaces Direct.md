# Lab D: Implement Storage Spaces Direct

## Scenario

You want to test whether using local storage as highly available storage is a viable solution, as your organization previously has used storage area networks (SANs) for storing virtual machines (VMs). The features in Windows Server 2022 enable using only local storage, so you want to implement Storage Spaces Direct as a test implementation.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Implement the **Storage Spaces Direct** feature.

## Estimated time: 30 minutes
## Exercise 1: Implement Storage Spaces Direct

### Scenario

You need to test the feasibility of using highly available storage, specifically the **Storage Spaces Direct** feature.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Install the **Storage Spaces Direct Failover Clustering** features.
2. Create and validate the failover cluster.
3. Enable **Storage Spaces Direct**.
4. Create the storage pool, a virtual disk, and a share.
5. Verify that **Storage Spaces Direct** functions properly.

### Task 1: Install the Storage Spaces Direct Failover Clustering features

1. Sign in to **LON-ADM1** as **`Contoso\Administrator`** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2. Select **Start**, and then select **Server Manager**.

3. In Server Manager, in the console tree, select **All Servers**, and verify that **LON-SVR1**, **LON-SVR2**, and **LON-SVR3** have a **Manageability** of **Online â€“ Performance counters not started** before continuing.

4. In Server Manager, in the **navigation** pane, select **File and Storage Services**, and then select **Disks**.

5. In the **Disks** pane, scroll until you find **LON-SVR3** disks 1 through 4, and verify that they are **Offline** and set to **Unknown**.

6. Right-click or access the context menu for each offline disk for **LON-SVR3**, select **Bring Online**, and then in the **Bring Disk Online** window, select **Yes**.

7. Repeat step 6 to bring all disks online for **LON-SVR1** and **LON-SVR2**.

8. Select **Start**, and in the **Start** menu, select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

9. When **Windows PowerShell ISE** completes loading, select **File**, select **Open**, and then navigate to **C:\Labfiles\Mod04**.

10. Select **Implement-StorageSpacesDirect.ps1**, and then select **Open**.

>Note: The script is divided into eight numbered steps, and each step has several commands. Run the commands by highlighting each command and selecting **F8**, one after the other, in accordance with the following instructions. Ensure each step finishes, meaning its status changes from **Stop operation** (a red square) to a **Run selection** (green arrow) in the menu bar *before* you begin the next step.

11. Select line 14 in Step 1 by highlighting the whole line, starting with the first **Invoke-Command**, and then select **F8**.

12. Wait until the installation finishes, and then verify that the command's output includes three lines (one for each server) with the **Success** listed as **True** for each.

13. Select line 15 in Step 1, starting with _second_ **Invoke-Command**, and then select **F8**.

>Note: When you start the second command to restart the servers, you can run the third command to install the console without waiting for the second command's restarts to finish.

14. Select line 16 in Step 1, starting with **Install**, and then select **F8**.

>Note: Wait a few minutes while the servers restart and the **Failover Cluster Manager** tool is added to **LON-ADM1**.  

15. Leave the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console open for the remainder of the exercise.

### Task 2: Create and validate a cluster
