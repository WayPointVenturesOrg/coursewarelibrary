# Lab: Monitor and troubleshoot Windows Server

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd is a global engineering and manufacturing company with its head office in Seattle, Washington, in the United States. An IT office and datacenter are in Seattle to support the Seattle location and other locations. Contoso recently deployed a Windows Server 2022 server and Windows 11 client infrastructure.

Because the organization deployed new servers, it's important to establish a performance baseline with a typical load for these new servers. You've been asked to work on this project. Additionally, to make the process of monitoring and troubleshooting easier, you decide to perform centralized monitoring of event logs.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Establish a performance baseline.
- Identify the source of a performance problem.
- Review and configure centralized event logs.

## Estimated time: 40 minutes
## Exercise 1: Establish a performance baseline

### Scenario

In this exercise, you'll use **Performance Monitor** on the server and create a baseline by using typical performance counters.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Create and start a data collector set.
2. Create a typical workload on the server.
3. Analyze the collected data.

### Task 1: Create and start a data collector set

1.  Sign in to **LON-ADM1** as **`Contoso\Administrator`** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.
2.  Select **Start**, enter **Perf**, and then in the **Best match** list, select **Performance Monitor**.
3.  In **Performance Monitor**, expand **Data Collector Sets**, and then select **User Defined**.
4.  Right-click or access the context menu for **User Defined**, select **New**, and then select **Data Collector Set**.
5.  In the **Create new Data Collector Set Wizard**, enter **`LON-ADM1 Performance`** in the **Name** box.
6.  Select **Create manually (Advanced)**, and then select **Next**.
7.  On the **What type of data do you want to include?** page, select the **Performance counter** checkbox, and then select **Next**.
8.  On the **Which performance counters would you like to log?** page, select **Add**.
9.  In the **Available counters** list, expand **Processor**, select **% Processor Time**, and then select **Add**.

13.  In the **Available counters** list, expand **System**, select **Processor Queue Length**, and then select **Add**.
14.  In the **Available counters** list, expand **Network Interface**, select **Bytes Total/sec**, select **Add**, and then select **OK**.
15.  On the **Which performance counters would you like to log?** page, enter **`1`** in the **Sample interval** box, and then select **Next**.
16.  On the **Where would you like the data to be saved?** page, select **Next**.
17.  On the **Create the data collector set?** page, select **Save and close**, and then select **Finish**.
18.  In **Performance Monitor**, on the **results** pane, right-click or access the context menu for **LON-ADM1 Performance**, and then select **Start**.

>Note: After starting the Data Collector Set, there might be a delay of 10 minutes for the results to display.

### Task 2: Create a typical workload on the server

1.  Select **Start**, enter **`Cmd`** in the search box, and then select **Command Prompt** in the **Best match** list.

2.  At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

4.  On the menu bar, select  **Change graph type** or select Ctrl+G, and then select **Report**.
5.  Record the values that are listed in the report for later analysis. Recorded values include:
   - Memory\Pages/sec @lab.TextBox(mem1)
   - Network Interface\Bytes Total/sec @lab.TextBox(net1)
   - PhysicalDisk\% Disk Time @lab.TextBox(disk1)
   - PhysicalDisk\Avg. Disk Queue Length @lab.TextBox(disk11)
