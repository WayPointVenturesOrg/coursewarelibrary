# Lab: Configure security in Windows Server

## Scenario

Contoso Pharmaceuticals is a medical research company with about 5,000 employees worldwide. They have specific needs for ensuring that medical records and data remain private. The company has a headquarters location and multiple worldwide sites. Contoso has recently deployed a Windows Server and Windows client infrastructure. You have been asked to implement improvements in the server security configuration.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure Windows Defender Credential Guard.
- Locate problematic user accounts.
- Implement and verify LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)

## Estimate time: 40 minutes

## Exercise 1: Configuring Windows Defender Credential Guard

### Scenario

You decide to implement Windows Defender Credential Guard on the servers and administrative workstations to protect against Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket credential thefts. You will use Group Policy to enable Credential Guard on your existing servers. For all new servers, you will use the hypervisor-protected code integrity and Windows Defender Credential Guard hardware readiness tool to enable Credential Guard before the new servers are domain joined.

In this lab, you will set up the Group Policy and run the hypervisor-protected code integrity and Windows Defender Credential Guard hardware readiness tool on an existing server.

> **Note**: In the lab environment, Credential Guard will not run VMs because they don't meet the requirements. You can still create the GPO (Group Policy Objects) and run the tool.

The main tasks for this exercise are to:

1. Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using Group Policy.
2. Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using the hypervisor-protected code integrity and Windows Defender Credential Guard hardware readiness tool.

### Task 1: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using Group Policy

1. Sign-in to **LON-ADM1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Select **Start**, and then enter **Group Policy Management**.
3. Select **Group Policy Management**.
4. In the Group Policy Management Console, expand **Forest: Contoso.com**, expand **Domains**, expand **Contoso.com**, right-click or access the context menu for the **IT** OU (Organizational Unit), and then select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here**.
5. In the **New GPO** dialog box, in the **Name** text box, enter **CredentialGuard_GPO**, and then select **OK**.
6. In the **Group Policy Management** window, under **IT**, right-click or access the context menu for **CredentialGuard_GPO**, and then select **Edit**.
7. In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to **Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Device Guard**.
8. Select **Turn On Virtualization Based Security**, and then select the **policy setting** link.
9. Select **Enabled**.
10. In the **Select Platform Security Level** drop-down list, select **Secure Boot and DMA Protection**.
10. In the **Credential Guard Configuration** drop-down list, select **Enabled with UEFI lock**.
11. In the **Secure Launch Configuration** drop-down list, select **Enabled**, and then select **OK**.
13. Close the Group Policy Management Editor.
14. Close the Group Policy Management Console.

### Task 2: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using the Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity and Windows Defender Credential Guard hardware readiness tool

1. On **LON-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

2. In the PowerShell ISE window enter the following command and then press Enter:

    ```
    cd C:\labfiles\Mod08
    ```

3. Enter the following command and then press Enter:

    ```powershell
    ./DG_Readiness_Tool.ps1 -Enable -AutoReboot
    ```

    > The readiness tool enables services and then restarts LON-ADM1. This may take several minutes to complete.

4. After LON-ADM1 restarts, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you will have:

1. Used Group Policy to implement Windows Defender Credential Guard on all computers in your organization.
2. Enabled Windows Defender Credential guard on LON-ADM1.

## Exercise 2: Locating problematic accounts

### Scenario

You need to check whether your organization has user accounts with passwords that are configured not to expire and remediate this setting. You also want to check which accounts haven’t signed in for 90 of days or more and disable them.

The main tasks for this exercise are to:

1. Locate and reconfigure accounts with passwords that don’t expire.
2. Locate and disable accounts to which no sign-ins have occurred for at least 90 days.

### Task 1: Locate and reconfigure accounts with passwords that don’t expire

1. If necessary, sign in to **LON-ADM1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. On **LON-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.
3. Enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $true -and PasswordNeverExpires -eq $true}
    ```

4. Review the list of user accounts returned.
5. Enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $true -and PasswordNeverExpires -eq $true} | Set-ADUser -PasswordNeverExpires $false
    ```

6. Rerun the command from step 3 and notice that no users are returned.

### Task 2: Locate and disable accounts to which no sign-ins have occurred for at least 90 days

1. Enter the following commands:

    ```cmd
    $days = (Get-Date).Adddays(-90)
    Get-ADUser -Filter {LastLogonTimeStamp -lt $days -and enabled -eq $true} -Properties LastLogonTimeStamp
    ```

2. In the lab environment, no accounts will be returned.
3. Enter the following command:

    ```cmd
    Get-ADUser -Filter {LastLogonTimeStamp -lt $days -and enabled -eq $true} -Properties LastLogonTimeStamp | Disable-ADAccount
    ```

4. No results will be returned in the lab environment.

5. Close Windows PowerShell ISE.

## Exercise 3: Implementing LAPS

### Scenario

At present, the same local administrator account password is used across all servers and workstations at Contoso. To remedy this problem, you will configure and deploy LAPs.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Prepare OU and computer accounts for LAPS.
2. Prepare AD DS (Active Directory) for LAPS.
3. Deploy LAPS client-side extension.
4. Verify LAPS.

### Task 1: Prepare OU and computer accounts for LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)

2. On **LON-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.
3. Enter the following commands:

    ```powershell
    New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Seattle_Servers"
    Get-ADComputer LON-SVR1 | Move-ADObject –TargetPath "OU=Seattle_Servers,DC=Contoso,DC=com"
    ```

4. Enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    Msiexec /I C:\Labfiles\Mod08\LAPS.x64.msi

### Results

After completing this lab, you will have:

- Prepared an OU and computer accounts for LAPs.
- Prepared your AD DS for LAPS.
- Deployed LAPS client-side extension.
- Verified that you implemented LAPS successfully.
