# Lab 2A: Creating and managing Exchange Online recipients

## Lab scenario

To efficiently manage an Exchange Online environment, you need to understand the foundational tasks of creating and managing recipient objects. This includes accounts related to users, resources, and contacts. It's also important to understand how various group types are created and managed in the Exchange organization. 

>**Note:** This lab requires students to first complete the **Module 1 lab: Exploring Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online administration portals**.
>
>To assist with your sign-in process, enter your Microsoft 365 Tenant name, sign-in username, and password as follows:
>
>- **Microsoft 365 Tenant name (ddmmyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com):** 
>- **Microsoft 365 Username (username@ddmmyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com):** 
>- **Password:** Pa55w.rd1234
