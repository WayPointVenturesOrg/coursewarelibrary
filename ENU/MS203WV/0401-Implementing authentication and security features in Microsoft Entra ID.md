# Lab: Implementing authentication and security features in Microsoft Entra ID

## Lab scenario

You need to implement authentication and security features for the tenant. You'll begin by using the Microsoft Entra admin center to create a new user and group for the Human Resources department. This user and group will be used to validate self-service password reset (SSRS) and multifactor authentication (MFA). MFA will be deployed by using a conditional access policy that takes effect whenever a member of the Human Resources department signs in to a Microsoft Office 365 app such as Microsoft Outlook.

>**Note:** This lab requires students to have first completed the **Module 1 lab: Exploring Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online administration portals**, and **Module 2: Lab A:Creating and managing Exchange Online recipients**.
>
>**Note:** This lab requires a valid phone number for approving MFA requests.
>
>To assist with your sign-in process, enter your Microsoft 365 Tenant name, sign-in username, and password as follows:
>
>- **Microsoft 365 Tenant name (ddmmyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com):** 
>- **Microsoft 365 Username (username@ddmmyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com):** 
>- **Password:** Pa55w.rd1234

## Exercise 1: Managing objects and reviewing authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID

### Scenario

Before implementing SSRS and MFA, you need to create a new user account and group. The group will also automatically assign licenses to members. You'll also review the authentication methods that you can enable for the tenant, and modify the default password protection settings. Finally, you'll verify that Security Defaults have been disabled so that you can implement conditional access policies for the tenant.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a new user by using the Microsoft Entra admin center.
2. Create a new group by using the Microsoft Entra admin center.
3. Review and configure authentication methods and password protection.
4. Review Security Defaults.

### Task 1: Create a new user by using the Microsoft Entra admin center

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **`Admin`** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  From the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

3.  In the address bar, enter **`https://entra.microsoft.com`**, and then select Enter.

4.  Sign in as **`username@ddmmyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com`** with the password **`Pa55w.rd1234`**. 

>**Note:** Use the credentials that you provided at the start of this lab.

5.  At the **Stay signed in** prompt, select **No**.

>**Note:** The Microsoft Entra admin center opens.

6.  In the **Microsoft Entra admin center** navigation pane, expand **Users**, and then select **All Users**.

>**Note:** Notice that the same user accounts display in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

7.  On the **All Users** page, select **New user**, and then select **Create new user**.

8.  On the **Basics** page, enter the following details, and then select **Next: Properties**:

   - **User principal name:** `Patti`@ddmmyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com
   - **Display name:** `Patti Fernandez`
   - **Auto-generate password:** Not selected
   - **Password:** `Pa55w.rd1234`
   - **Account enabled:** Selected

9.  On the **Properties** page, enter the following details:

   - **Job title:** `HR Manager`
   - **Department:** `HR`

10.  Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.

11.  On the **Review and finish** page, review your settings, select **Finish adding**, and then select **Close** on the confirmation page.

>**Note:** **Patti Fernandez** should now display on the **Users** page. However, you might first need to refresh the page.

### Task 2: Create a new group by using the Microsoft Entra admin center

1.  In the **Microsoft Entra admin center** navigation pane,, expand **Groups**, and then select **All groups**.

2.  On the **All groups** page, select **New group**.

3.  On the **New Group** page, enter the following details:

   - **Group type:** Security

7.  On the **All groups** page, select **Human Resources**.

8.  In the **Manage** section, select **Licenses**.

9.  On the **Licenses** page for Human Resources, select **Assignments**.

10.  On the **Update license assignments** page, select the **Microsoft 365 E3** checkbox, and then select **Save**.

>**Note:** You have configured the **Human Resources** security group with a license assignment. Any member of the Human Resources security group will automatically be assigned a Microsoft 365 E3 license.

### Task 3: Review and configure authentication methods and password protection

1.  In the **Microsoft Entra** admin center navigation pane, expand **Protection**, and then select **Authentication methods**.

>**Note:** The **Policies** page is selected by default.

2.  On the **Policies** page, review the authentication methods that can be enabled for the tenant.

>**Note:** After September 30th, 2025, this is where you will need to enable and manage authentication methods for MFA and SSRS.  

3.  On the **Authentication methods** page, select **Password protection**.

4.  On the **Password protection** page, enter the following details, and then select **Save**:

   - **Lockout threshold:** `15`
   - **Enforce custom list:** Yes
   - **Custom banned password list**: Enter `Contoso`, and then select Enter. Then enter `Seattle` on a separate line

### Task 4: Review Security Defaults

1.  In the **Microsoft Entra admin center** navigation pane, expand **Identity**, and then select **Overview**.

2.  On the **Contoso** page, select **Properties**.

3.  Scroll to the end of the page, and then select **Manage security defaults**.

4.  On the **Security defaults** page, verify that the defaults are **Disabled**.

>**Note:** You disabled the Security defaults in Lab 1: **Exploring Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online administration portals**. Security Defaults are enabled by default. In a production environment, you would only disable this setting if you plan to use Conditional Access policies, which you plan to do later in this lab. 

**Results:** After completing this exercise, you'll have created objects and reviewed and modified authentication methods by using Microsoft Entra admin center.

## Exercise 2: Configuring SSPR
