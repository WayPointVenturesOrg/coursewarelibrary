# Lab 5A: Managing mail flow for Exchange Online

## Lab scenario

Your organization collaborates with a partner organization named Adatum Corporation that uses a domain name of Adatum.com. You need to implement secure email communication between Contoso and Adatum.com by using connectors. You also plan to create a mail flow rule to ensure that whenever anyone sends email to Adatum.com, the message is sent through the proper connector. You also need to create a couple of additional mail flow rules to add a company disclaimer and for detecting email messages based upon key words.

>**Note:** This lab requires students to first complete the **Module 1 lab: Exploring Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online administration portals**, and **Module 2: Lab A: Creating and managing Exchange Online recipients**.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Connectors to manage mail flow

### Scenario

You plan to implement secure communication between your organization and Adatum.com. Adatum has an on-premises email system and doesn't use Exchange Online. To facilitate secure email with Adatum.com, you need to create two connectors. One connector will ensure that outbound email to Adatum.com uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the connection. The connection will only occur if the certificate used by Adatum.com is trusted by a certification authority (CA) and uses the common name \*.adatum.com. The second connector will ensure that any email received from Adatum.com is secure by again validating the \*.adatum.com TLS certificate.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a new Connector to send email to a partner organization.
2. Create a new Connector to receive email from a partner organization.

### Task 1: Create a new Connector to send email to a partner organization

1.  On **LON-CL1**, from the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

2.  In the address bar, enter **`https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com`**, and then select Enter.

3.  Sign in as **`username@ddmmyyyourinitialsContoso.onmicrosoft.com`** with the password **`Pa55w.rd1234`**. 

>**Note:** Use the credentials that you provided at the start of this lab.

4.  At the **Stay signed in** prompt, select **No**.

>**Note:** The Exchange admin center opens.

5.  In the navigation pane, expand **Mail flow**, and then select **Connectors**.

6.  On the **Connectors** page, select **Add a connector**.

7.  In the **Add a connector** wizard, on the **New connector** page, configure the following details, and then select **Next**:

   - **Connection from:** Office 365
   - **Connection to:** Partner organization

8.  On the **Connector name** page, enter the following details, and then select **Next**:

   - **Name:** `Send to Adatum.com`
   - **Description:** `Secure connection to Adatum.com`
   - **What do you want to do after the connector is saved?** Turn it on

9.  On the **Use of connector** page, select **Only when I have a transport rule set up that redirects messages to this connector**, and then select **Next**.

10.  On the **Routing** page, select **Use the MX record associated with the partner's domain**, and then select **Next**.

11.  On the **Security restrictions** page, configure the following details, and then select **Next**:

    - **Always use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the connection:** Selected
    - **Issued by a trusted certificate authority:** Selected
    - **Add the subject name or subject alternative name (SAN) matches this domain name:** `*.adatum.com`

12.  On the **Validation email** page, enter **`User1@adatum.com`**, select **Add** (the plus symbol), and then select **Validate**.

>**Note:** The validation may take a few minutes to complete. However, it will fail, which is expected because Adatum is a fictitious company. In a real environment, validation should complete with a successful result.

13.  On the **Validation email** page, select **Next**, and then at the **Are you sure** message, select **Yes, proceed**.

14.  On the **Review connector** page, select **Create connector**, and then select **Done**.

### Task 2: Create a new Connector to receive email from a partner organization

1.  In the Exchange admin center, on the **Connectors** page, select **Add a connector**.

2.  In the **Add a connector wizard**, on the **New connector** page, configure the following details, and then select **Next**:

  - **Connection from:** Partner organization
  - **Connection to:** Office 365 (Automatically selected)

3.  On the **Connector name** page, enter the following details, and then select **Next**:

  - **Name:** `Receive from Adatum.com`
  - **Description:** `Secure connection from Adatum.com`
  - **What do you want to do after the connector is saved?:** Turn it on

4.  On the **Authenticating sent email** page, select **by verifying that the sender domain matches one of the following domains**.

5.  In the text box, enter **`*.adatum.com`**, select **Add** (the plus symbol), and then select **Next**.

6.  On the **Security restrictions** page, configure the following details, and then select **Next**:

   - **Reject email messages if they aren't sent over TLS:** Selected
   - **And require that the subject name on the certificate that the partner uses to authenticate with Office 365 matches this domain name:** Selected
   - Text box:  **`*.adatum.com`**

7.  On the **Review connector** page, select **Create connector**, and then select **Done**.

**Results:** After completing this exercise, you'll have created two connectors for secure email connectivity with Fabrikam.com.

## Exercise 2: Configuring Mail flow rules

### Scenario
