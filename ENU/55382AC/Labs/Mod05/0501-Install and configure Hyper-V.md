# Lab: Install and configure Hyper-V

## Scenario

IT management at Contoso Ltd. is concerned about the low utilization of many of the physical servers that are deployed in the London datacenter. Contoso also is exploring options for expanding into multiple branch offices and deploying servers in both public and private clouds. For this purpose, the organization is exploring the use of virtual machines (VMs).

You will validate the Microsoft Hyper-V server role, configure VM storage and networking, and then deploy the VMs. 

## Objectives

- Verify the Hyper-V server role installation.
- Configure Hyper-V networks.
- Create and configure VMs.
- Enable nested virtualization.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes
## Exercise 1: Verifying the installation of the Hyper-V server role

### Scenario

The first step in migrating to a virtualized environment is to install the Hyper-V server role on a new server. Because this role is already installed on **LON-SVR1**, you need to verify the presence of the Hyper-V role.

The main task for this exercise is as follows:

- Verify and configure the Hyper-V server role.

### Task 1: Verify and configure the Hyper-V server role

1.  On **LON-SVR1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  Select **Start**, and then select **Server Manager**.

3.  In Server Manager, select **Tools**, and then select **Hyper-V Manager**.

4.  In **Hyper-V Manager**, select **LON-SVR1**, and then select **Hyper-V Settings**.

5.  In the **Hyper-V Settings for** **LON-SVR1** window, select each of the available settings and review their descriptions.

6.  In the settings list, select **Virtual Hard Disks**.

7.  On the **Virtual Hard Disks** page, select **Browse**. 

8.  Browse to and select **E:\\VirtualMachines**, and then select the **Select Folder** button.

9.  In the settings list, select **Virtual Machines**.

10.  On the **Virtual Machines** page, select **Browse**. 

11.  Browse to and select **E:\\VirtualMachines**, and then select the **Select Folder** button.

>You have now specified the default folder for storing Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs) and Virtual Machine files.

12.  Select **OK** to close the **Hyper-V Settings for** **LON-SVR1** window.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you successfully verified the presence and configuration of the Hyper-V server role on **LON-SVR1**.

## Exercise 2: Configuring Hyper-V networks

### Scenario

After installing the Hyper-V server role on the new server, you must configure the virtual networks. To find the differences between the different network types, you must create an external, internal, and private network.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an external network.
2. Create a private network.
3. Create an internal network.

### Task 1: Create an external network

6.  From the External network drop-down menu, select **Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter #3**.

7.  Ensure that the **Allow management operating system to share this network adapter** checkbox is selected, and then select **OK**.

8.  In the **Apply Networking Changes** dialog box, review the warning that displays, and then select **Yes**.

9.  Switch to **Server Manager**. Select **Local Server**, and then verify that there is a network adapter named **vEthernet** **(Physical Network)**.

### Task 2: Create a private network

1.  On **LON-SVR1**, in **Hyper-V Manager**, in the **Actions** pane, select **Virtual Switch Manager**.

2.  In the **Virtual Switch Manager for LON-SVR1** window, select **New virtual network switch**.

3.  In the **Create virtual switch** pane, select **Private**, and then select **Create Virtual Switch**.

4.  In the **Virtual Switch** **Properties** pane, in the **Name** text box, enter **`Isolated Network`**.

5.  In the **Connection type** area, verify that **Private network** is selected, and then select **OK**.

6.  In **Server Manager**, verify that no new network adapter has been added and that a private network isn't connected to any physical network adapter on the host machine.

### Task 3: Create an internal network

1.  On **LON-SVR1**, in **Hyper-V Manager**, in the **Actions** pane, select **Virtual Switch Manager**.

2.  In the **Virtual Switch Manager for LON-SVR1** window, select **New virtual network switch**.

3.  In the **Create virtual switch** pane, select **Internal**, and then select **Create Virtual Switch**.

4.  In the **Virtual Switch Properties** pane, in the **Name** text box, enter **`Host Internal Network`**.

6.  In **Server Manager**, verify that a new network adapter named **vEthernet** **(Host Internal Network)** has been created and is using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to obtain a network address.

>You might need to refresh **Server Manager** to validate the changes.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you should have successfully configured an external, internal, and private network.
