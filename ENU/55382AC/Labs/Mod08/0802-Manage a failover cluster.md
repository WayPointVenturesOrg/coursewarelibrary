# Lab B: Manage a failover cluster

## Scenario

Contoso Ltd. recently implemented failover clustering to provide increased availability for critical services, and your manager wants you to go through some failover-cluster management tasks so that you're prepared to manage it going forward. 

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Evict a node and verify changes.
- Change the quorum from a disk witness to a file-share witness.
- Verify high availability.

## Estimated time: 30 minutes
## Exercise 1: Evict a node, and verify quorum settings

### Scenario

You've recently added a node to the cluster to test your organizationâ€™s application scalability. Some of your organization employees have moved to another department and won't be using the clustered application any more. According to your test, you won't need the current number of nodes in the cluster, so you'll evict one node from it.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Evict node **LON-SVR4**.

2. Verify changes to the cluster.

### Task 1: Evict node LON-SVR4

1.  Sign in to **LON-SVR3** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.
2.  Select **Start**, and then select **Server Manager**.
3.  From **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Failover Cluster Manager**.
4.  In **Failover Cluster Manager**, expand the **Cluster1.Contoso.com** cluster, and then select **Nodes**.

5.  Right-click or access the context menu for the **LON-SVR4** node, select **More Actions**, and then select **Evict**.

6.  In the **Evict node LON-SVR4** dialog box, select **Yes** to evict the node.

### Task 2: Verify changes to the cluster

1.  Select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

2.  In the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, enter following cmdlet, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Get-ClusterNode | select name, nodeweight, ID, state
   ```

>Verify that **LON-SVR4** doesn't display in the results.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you'll have evicted a node from the cluster, and verified the changes in the cluster.

## Exercise 2: Change the quorum from a disk witness to a file-share witness

### Scenario

You've introduced a new application in your organization that works better by using scenarios with the File Share Witness quorum model. You need to modify the quorum model for the Failover cluster.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Get the current quorum model.

2. Create a file share on **LON-SVR1**.

3. Change the current quorum model to a file-share witness.

4. Verify that the current quorum model is a file-share witness.

### Task 1: Get the current quorum model

1.  Sign in to **LON-SVR2** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  Select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

3.  In the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Get-ClusterQuorum | Select Cluster, QuorumResource, QuorumType
   ```

### Task 2: Create a file share on LON-SVR1

1.  Sign in to **LON-SVR1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.
2.  On **LON-SVR1**, on the taskbar, select **File Explorer**, right-click or access the context menu for the disk **Local Disk (C:)**, select **New**, and then select **Folder**. 
3.  Enter **FSW**, and then select Enter.

4.  Right-click or access the context menu for **FSW**, select **Give access to**, and then select **Specific people**. 

5.  In the **Network access** dialog box, enter **Everyone**, and then select **Add**. 

6.  In the **Read** list, select **Read/Write**. 

7.  Select **Share**, and then select **Done**.

### Task 3: Change the current quorum model to a file-share witness

1.  Switch to **LON-SVR2**.

2.  On **LON-SVR2**, in the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Set-ClusterQuorum -NodeAndFileShareMajority "\\LON-SVR1\FSW"
   ```

### Task 4: Verify that the current quorum model is a file-share witness

1.  On **LON-SVR2**, in the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Get-ClusterQuorum | Select Cluster, QuorumResource, QuorumType
   ```

### Results

After completing this exercise, you'll have changed the quorum from disk witness to file-share witness.

## Exercise 3: Verify high availability

### Scenario

You want to test your high-availability solution by taking one of your servers offline and then verifying that your applications, services, and data are still available to clients. After you verify that high availability works, you'll bring the server back online.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Simulate server failure.

2. Verify functionality and file availability in Cluster1.

3. Validate whether the file is still available.

### Task 1: Simulate server failure

1.  Switch to **LON-SVR2**, and then from **Server Manager** open **Failover Cluster Manager**.

2.  In the **Failover Cluster Manager** console, expand **Cluster1.Contoso.com**, and then select **Roles**. 

3.  In the **Owner Node** column, notice the current owner of **ContosoFS**.

>The owner will be **LON-SVR2** or **LON-SVR3**.

4.  If **LON-SVR3** isn't the owner, right-click or access the context menu for **ContosoFS**, select **Move**, select **Select Node**, select **LON-SVR3**, and then select **OK**.

5.  Shut down **LON-SVR3**.

### Task 2: Verify functionality and file availability in Cluster1

1.  Sign in to **LON-DC1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  On **LON-DC1**, open **File Explorer**. 

3.  In the address bar, enter **`\\ContosoFS\`**, and then select Enter.

>Verify that you can access the location and open the **Docs** folder. 

4.  Create a test text document named **test2.txt** inside this folder.

### Task 3: Validate whether the file is still available

1.  Start the **LON-SVR3** virtual machine (VM).

>Wait for **LON-SVR3** to fully start before continuing with the next steps.

2.  Sign in to **LON-SVR3** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **`Pa55w.rd`**.

3.  Switch to **LON-SVR2**, and then in the **Failover Cluster Manager** console, expand **Cluster1.Contoso.com**, and then select **Roles**. 

4.  Right-click or access the context menu for **ContosoFS**, select **Move**, select **Select Node**, select **LON-SVR3**, and then select **OK**.

5.  On **LON-DC1**, open **File Explorer**. 

6.  In the address bar, enter **`\\ContosoFS\`**, and then select Enter.

   > Verify that you can access the location and open the **Docs** folder. 

7.  Create a test text document named **test3.txt** inside this folder.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you'll have tested failover cluster high availability successfully by taking a server offline and then bringing it back online.
