# Lab: Use MDT to deploy Windows Server

## Scenario

Contoso Corporation is a global engineering and manufacturing company with its main office in London, UK. An IT office and datacenter are located in London to support the London location and others. Contoso has recently deployed a Windows Server 2022 server and Windows 11 client infrastructure.

As the datacenter has grown, it's become apparent that there can be significant time savings if server deployment is automated by using customized images rather than manually installing each server. You decide to implement an automation process for deploying servers using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT). 

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Configure MDT.
- Create and deploy an image.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Exercise 1: Configure MDT

### Scenario

You need to test the capabilities of the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit. MDT has already been installed on **LON-SVR1**, so your next step is to configure the MDT deployment share to prepare the MDT environment for image deployment.

The main task for this exercise is:

- Configure the deployment share.

### Task 1: Configure the deployment share

1. On **LON-SVR1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. On the taskbar, select **File Explorer**, and then browse to **E:\\ISOs**.

3. Right-click or access the context menu for **Win2022_Eval.iso**, and then select **Mount**. 

   > The ISO mounts as DVD Drive F.

4. Close **File Explorer**.

5. Select **Start**, expand **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

6. In the **Deployment Workbench**, right-click or access the context menu for **Deployment Shares**, and then select **New Deployment Share**. 

   > The **New Deployment Share Wizard** opens.


7. On the **Path** page, under **Deployment share path**, change the value to **E:\DeploymentShare**, and then select **Next**.

8. On the **Share** page, take note of the **Share name**, but don't change it. Select **Next**.

9. On the **Descriptive Name** page, accept the default value, and then select **Next**.

10. On the **Options** page, configure the following, and then select **Next**:

       - Ask to set the local Administrator password: **Enabled**

       - All other checkboxes: **Disabled**

11. On the **Summary** page, review the information, and then select **Next**. 

12. On the **Confirmation** page, ensure that the process completed successfully, and then select **Finish**.

13. Expand **Deployment Shares**, and then expand the **MDT Deployment Share** folder. 

    > Take note of the various nodes that you can configure for the deployment share. The nodes should include **Applications**, **Operating Systems**, **Out-of-Box Drivers**, **Packages**, **Task Sequences**, **Advanced Configuration**, and **Monitoring**.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you should have configured the MDT Deployment Share.

## Exercise 2: Create and deploy an image

### Scenario

You need to deploy a new Windows Server 2022 virtual machine (VM) named **LON-SVR7**. You'll use MDT to deploy the operating system (OS) image to a VM created in Hyper-V. You've already created an MDT deployment share, so your next step is to add components to the share and then configure the task sequence that will perform the steps to deploy the image.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Add OS files to the Deployment Share.

2. Create an MDT Task Sequence.

4. Configure Deployment Share Properties and Windows PE settings.

5. Deploy Windows Server 2022 using MDT.

### Task 1: Add OS files to the Deployment Share

3. In the **Import Operating System Wizard**, on the **OS Type** page, select **Full set of source files**, and then select **Next**.

4. On the **Source** page, under **Source directory**, enter **`F:\`**, and then select **Next**.

5. On the **Destination** page, change the default destination directory name to **Windows Server 2022**, and then select **Next**.


6. On the **Summary** page, review the information, and then select **Next**. 

   > The OS source files are copied into the deployment share.

7. On the **Confirmation** page, ensure that the process completed successfully, and then select **Finish**.
