# Lab: Plan and configure storage technologies and components

## Scenario

You are a Storage Administrator for Contoso, Ltd. Part of your job is to ensure that your data storage systems meet both short-term and long-term business needs that evolve regularly. 

## Objectives

- Plan storage requirements.
- Configure Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) storage.
- Configure and manage shares.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes
## Exercise 1: Planning storage requirements

### Scenario

Contoso Ltd. wants to design new storage solutions to support several recent changes:

- External customers are more frequently using web applications, and these customers are requiring more and new business services.

- Internal users need more support and more internal infrastructure services.

- Requirements for managing block-level storage and shared file access have expanded.

- A recently acquired company uses a different IT infrastructure than Contoso, and the IT department now needs to manage a mixed environment that includes remote geographical areas in London, New York, and Japan.

- The cost of storage has decreased significantly over recent years.

- The amount of data produced by Contoso business groups continues to increase at a faster rate.


### Requirements

In general, the new storage system should be low‑cost, and have reasonable performance. In addition, storage administrators at both Contoso and the newly acquired company should be able to manage it easily.

The new storage system should include:

- Centralized management and control over the storage infrastructure.

- Support for applications that require large amounts of storage for Microsoft SQL Server databases.

- An easy, inexpensive way to provision block-level storage that has minimal management overhead.

- The provisioning of VMWare ESXi virtual machines (VMs).

- The provisioning of Microsoft Hyper‑V VMs.

- Support for UNIX clients that require access to shared folders.

- Share access for older clients, if it's required.


As part of fulfilling this requirement, you will determine if older clients—including Windows 7 and Windows 8—need access to shares, and you then will remove any legacy shares that your users are not utilizing.

### Proposals

As a senior server administrator at Contoso, you're responsible for implementing the new file storage technologies for the organization. After reviewing the requirements, you propose a plan based on answers to the following questions:

- You plan to evaluate how iSCSI, Fibre Channel, and InfiniBand solutions meet the requirements. Which solution do you expect to select?

- Which storage—block-level storage or file-level storage—do you plan to implement for the SQL Server databases?

- How will your solution minimize administrative overhead for the storage administrators?

- Which server role (or roles) do you plan to use for the provisioning of VMWare ESXi VMs?

- Will you run the Hyper‑V VMs on network file system (NFS) or Server Message Block (SMB)?

- Which file sharing protocol will you use for UNIX clients that require access?

- How do you plan to disable legacy SMB access for existing SMB file shares?


The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Read the supporting documentation.
2. Record your planned course of action.

### Task 1: Read the supporting documentation

-  Read the supporting documentation in the lab exercise scenario.

### Task 2: Record your planned course of action

Record your answers to the following questions:

1.  You plan to evaluate how iSCSI, Fibre Channel, and InfiniBand solutions meet your requirements. Which solution do you expect to select?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > You wouldn't use InfiniBand because the requirements call for reasonable performance and low cost. InfiniBand is for high‑performance solutions, and it's more  expensive. Of the two remaining choices, iSCSI most closely matches the low cost and reasonable performance requirements that you expect. Therefore, you should deploy an iSCSI solution to each of the geographic locations that has an IT infrastructure and requires more storage.
</details>

2.  Which storage type do you plan to implement for the SQL databases: block-level storage or file-level storage?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > Based on the requirements alone, you could use either storage type because each has its own advantages and disadvantages. SQL databases can run SMB file shares since the release of SMB 3.0, and the overall performance is similar to that of block-level storage. The answer might depend on whether you have an existing highly available SMB file server infrastructure, and whether the server team or the storage team will manage the storage.
</details>

3.  How will your solution minimize administrative overhead for storage administrators?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > By selecting iSCSI, you avoid the complexities of Fibre Channel and InfiniBand solutions. In addition, an iSCSI solution requires less hardware and software. All of these choices reduce the administrative overhead for storage administrators.
</details>

4.  Which server role (or roles) do you plan to use for VMWare ESXi VM provisioning?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > You can use the Server for the NFS role to create NFS file shares that VMWare ESXi VMs support.
</details>

5.  Will you run the Hyper-V VMs on NFS or SMB?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > The Hyper‑V virtual machines can run on SMB, but NFS doesn't support them. Therefore, you will need to run the VMs on SMB.
</details>

6.  Which file sharing protocol will you use for UNIX clients that require access?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > Historically, NFS was the protocol of choice for UNIX clients to access file shares. However, today most UNIX clients equally support NFS and SMB natively. Therefore, you can use either of the technologies. If you have an existing NFS file sharing deployment, you will likely choose NFS. If you have an existing SMB file sharing deployment, you will likely choose SMB.
</details>

7.  How do you plan to disable legacy SMB access for existing SMB file shares?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > First, you need to locate all of the existing file servers that have legacy SMB shares. You can check for legacy shares on the current host by using the following command at a Windows PowerShell prompt:
   >
   > ```
   > Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select EnableSMB1Protocol
   > ```
   >
   > You also can create a Windows PowerShell script to check for legacy shares on all the file servers.
   >
   > After you have located all of the existing file servers that have legacy SMB shares, you then need to disable  SMB access. You can disable the SMB 1 protocol on each server by using the following command:
   >
   > ```
   > Set-SmbServerConfiguration ‑EnableSMB1Protocol $false
   > ```
   >
   > You also can create a Windows PowerShell script to disable legacy SMB access across all of your servers.
</details>

### Results

After completing this exercise, you will have successfully planned a storage solution that will meet your organization’s requirements.

## Exercise 2: Configuring iSCSI storage

12.  On the **View results** page, select **Close**.

### Task 3: Use Windows PowerShell to view share information

1.  Switch to **LON-DC1**.

2.  On **LON-DC1**, on the taskbar, select **File Explorer**.

3.  In **File Explorer**, in the address bar, enter **`\\LON-SVR1\Data`**, and then select Enter.

4.  Select the **Home** tab, select **New item**, and then select **Text Document**.

5.  Enter **NewFile**, and then select Enter to rename the document.

6.  Open **NewFile.txt** to open it in Notepad.

>Leave Notepad open for later in the task.

7.  Switch to **LON-SVR1**.

8.  On **LON-SVR1**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

9.  At the Windows PowerShell prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

    ```

    Get-SmbOpenFile
    ```

>  There are two entries for **Contoso\\Administrator**: File Explorer creates one, and Notepad creates the other. If **NewFile.txt** isn't included, it's because the file connection is maintained only for brief periods when you open the file initially or save it. If you don't have two entries, switch to **LON-DC1**, close Notepad, and then open **NewFile.txt**. Then, on **LON-SVR1**, repeat step 15. 

16.  Leave the Windows PowerShell prompt open for the next task.

### Task 4: Disable the legacy SMB1 protocol

1.  On **LON-SVR1**, at the **Windows PowerShell** prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```

2.  For the confirmation message, select **Yes**.

3.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
Get-SmbServerConfiguration | FL enable*
   ```

4.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
