# Lab: Implement failover clustering with Hyper-V

## Scenario

The initial deployment of virtual machines (VMs) on Hyper-V has been successful for Contoso. As a next step in VM deployment, you're considering ways to ensure that the services and applications deployed on the VMs are highly available. As part of the high-availability implementation, you also need to consider options for making VMs that run on Hyper-V highly available.

As a Contoso senior network administrator, you're responsible for integrating Hyper-V with failover clustering to ensure that VMs deployed on Hyper-V are highly available, for planning VM and storage configuration, and for implementing VMs as highly available services on the failover cluster. 

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Configure a failover cluster for Hyper-V.
- Configure a highly available VM.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes
## Exercise 1: Configure a failover cluster for Hyper-V

### Scenario

You're responsible for implementing Hyper-V VMs as highly available services on a failover cluster, which will use Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) storage that's already configured and available on **LON-SVR4**. You need to first connect the cluster nodes (**LON-SVR2** and **LON-SVR3**) to the iSCSI storage. Next, you'll install and configure failover clustering and prepare the disk storage for the cluster.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Connect cluster nodes to iSCSI shared storage.
2. Install the **Failover Clustering** feature.
3. Validate and create a failover cluster.
4. Configure disks for a failover cluster.

### Task 1: Connect cluster nodes to iSCSI shared storage

5.  In the new **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
$cred=Get-Credential
   ```

6.  When prompted, provide the credentials as **`Contoso\Administrator`** with password **`Pa55w.rd`**.

7.  In the new **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
$sess = New-PSSession -Credential $cred -ComputerName lon-svr3.contoso.com
   ```

8.  After running the previous command, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
Enter-PSSession $sess
   ```

9.  Verify that **lon-svr3.contoso.com** appears at the beginning of the command prompt.

>You're now connected to **LON-SVR3** using PowerShell remoting.

10.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window for **LON-SVR3**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
Install-WindowsFeature –Name Failover-Clustering –IncludeManagementTools
   ```

> Wait until the Failover clustering feature installation is complete on **LON-SVR2** and **LON-SVR3**, and then continue with the following steps. 

11.  Close both Windows PowerShell ISE windows.

### Task 3: Validate and create a failover cluster

1.  On **LON-SVR2**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

2.  At the **Windows PowerShell ISE** command prompt, enter **`Test-Cluster LON-SVR2, LON-SVR3`**, and then select Enter.

> Wait for a few minutes for the cluster validation test to complete. You can expect a few warning messages to appear, but there should be no errors.

3.  At the **Windows PowerShell ISE** command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   New-Cluster -Name VMCluster -Node lon-svr2 -StaticAddress 172.16.0.126
   ```

>You should receive a cluster name as a result. It should display **Name VMCluster**. Verify that there are no errors.

4.  At the **Windows PowerShell ISE** command prompt,  enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Add-ClusterNode -Name LON-SVR3
   ```

>This command adds LON-SVR3 as a second node to the cluster. When a command prompt appears, verify that no errors are reported.

5.  Close the **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

### Task 4: Configure disks for a failover cluster

1.  On **LON-SVR2**, in the **Server Manager** console, select **Tools** and then select **Failover Cluster Manager**.

2.  In the **Failover Cluster Manager** console, expand **VMCluster.Contoso.com**, expand **Storage**, and then select **Disks**. 

3.  Ensure that three disks named **Cluster Disk 1**, **Cluster Disk 2**, and **Cluster Disk 3** are present and online.

4.  Right-click or access the context menu for **Cluster Disk 1**, and then select **Add to Cluster Shared Volumes**.

5.  Right-click or access the context menu for **VMCluster.Contoso.com**, select **More Actions**, select **Configure Cluster Quorum Settings**, and then select **Next**.

6.  On the **Select Quorum Configuration Option** page, select **Use default quorum configuration**, and then select **Next**.

7.  On the **Confirmation** page, select **Next**.

8.  On the **Summary** page, select **Finish.**

9.  Ensure that **LON-SVR2** is the owner of the disk that you just assigned to the **Cluster Shared Volume**. You can read the owner value in the **Owner Node** column. If that isn't the case, then move the disk to **LON-SVR2** before proceeding to the next task. 

>To move the disk: 
>
> - Right-click or access the context menu for **Cluster Disk 1**, and then select **Move**. 
>
> - Select **Select Node**, select **LON-SVR2**, and then select **OK**.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you'll have successfully configured the failover-clustering infrastructure for Hyper-V.

## Exercise 2: Configure a highly available VM

3.  In the **Move Virtual Machine** dialog box, select **LON-SVR3**, and then select **OK**. 

> Wait until the machine is migrated to **LON-SVR3**. You'll notice that the **Owner** **Node** column changes the value when migration completes.

4.  In **Failover Cluster Manager**, right-click or access the context menu for **LON-SVR5**, and select **Shut Down**.

### Task 4: Configure drain on shutdown

1.  On **LON-SVR2**,  select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

2.  At the **Windows PowerShell ISE** command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   (Get-Cluster).DrainOnShutdown
   ```

>**Note:** This should return a value of “**1**”.

3.  On **LON-SVR2**, switch to **Failover Cluster Manager**.

4.  Select **Roles** in **Failover Cluster Manager**.

>Notice that **LON-SVR3** currently owns **LON-SVR5**.

5.  Shut down the **LON-SVR3**.

6.  On **LON-SVR2**, monitor the **Failover Cluster Manager**, and verify that **LON-SVR5** live migrates to **LON-SVR2** before shutting down **LON-SVR3**.

### Results
After completing this exercise, you'll have successfully configured a VM as highly available.
