# Lab: Implement WSUS, and deploy updates

## Scenario

Contoso Ltd. has a head office in London and a branch office in Toronto. The branch office contains a research department for the organization.

The Toronto location contains several Windows Server 2022 servers. Each server is individually configured to contact Windows update services and perform quality updates as needed. This has made it difficult to ensure that all servers are updated within the same timeframe. You plan to streamline the update process by implementing Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). You intend to use WSUS to manage quality, feature, and Office 365 updates for the entire organization for both Windows Server and Windows 11 devices. 

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Implement the WSUS server role.
- Configure update settings.
- Approve and deploy an update by using WSUS.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Exercise 1: Implement the WSUS server role

### Scenario

Contoso Ltd. has a WSUS implementation that covers its head office location. The WSUS server role is installed on a server named **LON-SVR2**. 

You need to configure WSUS to manage updates for the remote location in Toronto. You plan to install the WSUS server role on a server named **LON-SVR4**, which is located in Toronto. To minimize the number of servers needing access to the Windows update service, you'll configure **LON-SVR4** to use **LON-SVR2** as the source for Windows Update downloads. 

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Install the WSUS server role.
2. Configure WSUS to synchronize with an upstream WSUS server.

### Task 1: Install the WSUS server role

1. Sign in to **LON-SVR4** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. On **LON-SVR4**, open **Server Manager**, select **Manage**, and then select **Add Roles and Features**.

3. In the **Add Roles and Features Wizard**, select **Next**.

4. On the **Select installation type** page, ensure that **Role-based** **or** **feature-based** **installation** is selected, and then select **Next**.

5. On the **Select destination server** page, select **Next**.

6. On the **Select server roles** page, select the **Windows Server Update Services** checkbox. In the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** window, select **Add Features**.

7. On the **Select server roles** page, select **Next**.

8. On the **Select features** page, select **Next**.

9. On the **Windows Server Update Services** page, select **Next**.

11. On the **Content location selection** page, in the text box, enter **C:\\WSUSUpdates**, and then select **Next**.

12. On the **Confirm installation selections** page, select **Install**.

    > It'll take several minutes for the installation to complete.

13. When the installation completes, select **Close**.

14. In Server Manager, select **Tools**, and then select **Windows Server Update Services**.

15. In the **Complete WSUS Installation** dialog box, select **Run**, wait for the post-installation task to complete, and then select **Close**.

    > The **Windows Server Update Services Configuration Wizard** starts.


### Task 2: Configure WSUS to synchronize with an upstream WSUS server

1. In the **Windows Server Update Services Configuration Wizard: LON-SVR4** window, select **Next** twice.

2. On the **Choose Upstream Server** page, select **Synchronize from another Windows Server Update Services server**, and in the **Server name** text box, enter **LON-SVR2.Contoso.com**, and then select **Next**.

3. On the **Specify Proxy Server** page, select **Next**.

4. On the **Connect to Upstream Server** page, select **Start Connecting**. Wait for the upstream server settings to be applied, and then select **Next**.

5. On the **Choose Languages** page, select **Next**.

6. On the **Set Sync Schedule** page, select **Next**.

7. On the **Finished** page, select the **Begin initial synchronization** checkbox, and then select **Finish**.

8. In the **Update Services** console, in the **navigation** pane, expand **LON-SVR4**, and then select **Synchronizations**.

   > Wait until synchronization status for the most recent synchronization indicates that it's 100% complete. It'll take several minutes to complete.

9. In the **navigation** pane, select **Options**.

10. In the **Options** pane, select **Computers**. 

11. In the **Computers** dialog box, select **Use Group Policy or registry settings on computers**, and then select **OK**. 


### Results

After completing this exercise, you'll have implemented the WSUS server role.

## Exercise 2: Configure update settings
