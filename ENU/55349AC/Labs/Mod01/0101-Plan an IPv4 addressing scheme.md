# Lab: Plan an IPv4 addressing scheme

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation is an international organization with its North American regional office located in Toronto, with plans to open three branch offices in Houston, Texas; Mexico City, Mexico; and Portland, Oregon.

The following table describes the planned computer distribution in the branch offices:

| **Location** | **Computer and device requirements**                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Houston      | 300 desktop computers and 100 laptop computers connecting to both the wireless and wired networks; 50 tablet computers connecting only to the wireless network. |
| Mexico City  | 100 desktop computers and 50 laptop computers connecting to both the wireless and wired networks; 20 tablet computers connecting only to the wireless network. |
| Portland     | 100 desktop computers and 75 laptop computers connecting to both the wireless and wired networks; 150 tablet computers connecting only to the wireless network. |

Contoso has a Microsoft 365 tenant for all email and file access for the North American branch offices, with some shared folders in the Toronto regional office located on servers that are running the Windows Server operating system (OS). All offices have fast and highly available network connections to the Toronto office, so Contoso isn't currently planning to deploy any servers in the branch offices.

The Contoso network team has assigned the subnets 172.16.18.0/18 to the Toronto regional office, which is currently using the network assignments that the following table lists: 

| **IP   subnet**                  | **Purpose**                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 172.16.18.0/24                   | Network devices and network printers |
| 172.16.19.0/24                   | Servers                              |
| 172.16.20.0/24 to 172.16.52.0/24 | Desktop computers                    |
| 172.16.53.0/24 to 172.16.60.0/24 | Wireless devices                     |

You need to plan an IPv4 address assignment for each of the branch offices, using IP addresses from the list of addresses assigned to the Toronto office. You also need to ensure that the IP addresses assigned to computers connected to wired connections differ from the IP addresses assigned to devices connected to the wireless networks.

## Exercise 1: Plan IPv4 address assignments

### Scenario

You need to plan the IP address assignment for each North American branch office, and your IP addressing scheme must meet the following requirements:

- Wired and wireless clients must be assigned IP addresses from different IP address ranges.

- Each branch office location should have dedicated IP address ranges.

- Subnets in branch-office locations must be as simple as possible.

- Branch-office subnets must have IP addresses for all potential wired and wireless clients that might request an IP address.


The main task for this exercise is:

1. Plan the IPv4 implementation.
