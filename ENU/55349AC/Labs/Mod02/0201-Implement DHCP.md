# Lab: Implement DHCP

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation is planning to open three new North American branch offices. The following table describes the planned computer distribution in the new branch office:

**Planned computer distribution**

| **Location** | **Computer  and device requirements**                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Houston      | 300 desktop computers and 100 laptops connecting to both the wireless and wired networks; 50 mobile devices connecting only to the wireless network. |
| Mexico City  | 100 desktop computers and 50 laptops connecting to both the wireless and wired networks; 20 mobile devices connecting only to the wireless network. |
| Portland     | 100 desktop computers and 75 laptops connecting to both the wireless and wired networks; 150 mobile devices connecting only to the wireless network. |

Contoso is using Microsoft Office 365 for all email and file access, with some shared folders in the Toronto regional office. All new offices have fast and highly available network connections to the Toronto office, so Contoso won’t deploy any servers in branch offices. The Contoso network team has assigned the subnets 172.16.18.0/18 to the Toronto main office, which is using the network assignments that the following table lists:

**Toronto office network assignments**

| **IP subnet**                    | **Purpose**                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 172.16.18.0/24                   | Network devices and network printers |
| 172.16.19.0/24                   | Servers                              |
| 172.16.20.0/24 to 172.16.52.0/24 | Desktop computers                    |
| 172.16.53.0/24 to 172.16.60.0/24 | Wireless devices                     |

Using this information, you must plan and implement Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to support your design.

## Exercise 1: Plan a DHCP server implementation

### Scenario

You must implement a network-server infrastructure that enables assignment of IP addresses to the Houston, Mexico City, and Portland offices. You’ll use TOR-SVR1 as the primary DHCP server. 

Your solution must meet the following requirements: 

- Wired and wireless clients must be assigned IP addresses from separate IP ranges. 
- Each location must maintain a separate IP address range from other locations. 
- Your solution must include a DHCP failover to provide DHCP address leases if TOR-SVR1 is unavailable.

The main task for this exercise is: 

- Plan a DHCP server implementation.

### Task 1: Plan a DHCP server implementation

Answer the following questions. Your answers will help you develop a plan for implementing a DHCP server infrastructure.

1.  What scopes do you need to create to implement the IP addressing scheme that you defined in module 1?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > **Answer:** Subnet assignments will vary, but possibilities are:
   >
   > Houston: Has 400 potential wired connections and 150 potential wireless connections. Houston will need two /24 subnets supernetted for the wired connections and one /24 subnet for the wireless connections. 
   >
   > Houston will use 172.16.30.0/24 and 172.16.31.0/24 supernetted for wired connections and 172.16.55.0/24 for wireless connections. 
   >
   > Mexico City: Has 150 potential wired connections and 70 potential wireless connections. Mexico City will use 172.16.35.0/24 for wired connections and 172.16.56.0/24 for wireless connections. 
   >
   > Portland: Has 175 potential wired connections and 225 potential wireless connections. Portland will use 172.16.40.0/24 for wired connections and 172.16.57.0/24 for wireless connections. 
   >
   > Wireless scopes will have a short duration of one day, and wired scopes will have a duration of eight days.
</details>

2.  Where will the Domain Name System (DNS) service come from?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > **Answer:** LON-DC1 will be the DNS server for all scopes.
</details>

3.  How will you get DHCP messages from TOR-SVR1 to clients in the Houston, Mexico City, and Portland locations?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > **Answer:** You’ll configure DHCP relay agents in the branches.
</details>

4.  What configuration changes do you need to make to NA-RTR to enable the IP addressing scheme through the DHCP relay?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > **Answer:** You’ll need to assign IP addresses to the interfaces from their respective branch subnets, and then configure them as DHCP relay agents.
</details>

5.  How will you assign different IP ranges to the clients in each location? How will you assign different IP addresses for wired and wireless clients?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > **Answer:** You’ll create multiple scopes on the DHCP server, and you’ll need a separate scope for each wired and wireless network. To distinguish between wired and wireless requests, you’ll configure the router as a DHCP relay agent for the wired connections, and then configure the wireless access points as relay agents for wireless requests. 
</details>

6.  Which IP addresses will you assign to the network interfaces on NA-RTR that are connected to the Houston, Mexico City, and Portland networks?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > **Answer:** You’ll assign IP address 172.16.30.1 to the Houston interface, IP address 172.16.35.1 to the Mexico City interface, and IP address 172.16.40.1 to the Portland interface.
</details>

7.  How will you provide for DHCP failover for TOR-SVR1?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
   > **Answer:** You’ll configure a failover relationship with LON-SVR1 as a hot standby DHCP server.
</details>
**Results:** After answering all questions in this exercise, you will have planned a DHCP implementation.

## Exercise 2: Implement the DHCP configuration

1.  Switch to the **TOR-SVR1** VM.

2.  On **TOR-SVR1**, in **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Services**. The **Services** console opens.

3.  In the **Services** console, in the details pane, select the **DHCP Server** service, and then on the taskbar, select the **Stop Service** icon. 

4.  Switch to the **LON-CL1** VM.

5.  On **LON-CL1**, in the **Windows PowerShell** window, enter **`ipconfig /release`**, and then select Enter. 

6.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, enter **`ipconfig /renew`**, and then select Enter. Wait a few seconds for LON-CL1 to obtain TCP/IP settings.

7.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, enter **`ipconfig /all`**, and then select Enter.

>LON-CL1 should obtain an IP address from the DHCP server with IP address 172.16.0.11 (LON-SVR1). Because you stopped the DHCP server on TOR-SVR1, the IP address was obtained from the standby DHCP server, LON-SVR1.

**Results:** After completing this exercise, you’ll have tested that you obtained the correct IP address for the connected subnet and that the standby DHCP server provided an IP address when the active DHCP server was stopped.
