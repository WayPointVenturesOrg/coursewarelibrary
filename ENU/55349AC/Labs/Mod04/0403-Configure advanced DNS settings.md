# Lab C: Configure advanced DNS settings

## Lab scenario

You want to make Domain Name System (DNS) zone management easier. You want to configure DNS policies in Windows Server, so that users in different geographical areas can connect to a different web server. You must then test and troubleshoot the DNS configuration that you've created.

### Prerequisites

You must complete the following lab(s) before beginning this lab:

- 0401-Planning and implementing DNS name resolution
- 0402-Integrating DNS with AD DS
## Exercise 1: Configuring DNS policies

### Scenario

If you configure DNS policies correctly, when clients in the Toronto location query for the IP address of `www.contoso.com`, they should receive different name-resolution answers than clients in the London location who're mapping to `www.contoso.com`.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Verify DNS name resolution before configuring DNS policies.
2. Configure DNS policies.
3. Validate DNS name resolution after configuring DNS policies.

### Task 1: Verify DNS name resolution before configuring DNS policies

1.  Switch to **LON-DC1**, and if necessary, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  Open **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **DNS**.

3.  In the **DNS Manager** console, expand **LON-DC1**, expand **Forward Lookup Zones**, and then select **Contoso.com**.

4.  Right-click **Contoso.com** to open the context menu, and then select **New Alias (CNAME)**.

5.  In the **New Resource Record** window, in the **Alias Name** text box, enter **`www`**, and in the **Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for target host** text box, enter **`LON-DC1.Contoso.com`**, and then select **OK**. 

6.  Switch to **TOR-SVR1** and if necessary, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

7.  On **TOR-SVR1**, click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

8.  In the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, enter the following two commands, and select Enter after each command:

   ```
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ```
   ```   
   nslookup www.contoso.com
   ```
9.  Verify that the last command returns the IP address **172.16.0.10**.

10.  Switch to **LON-CL1** and, if necessary, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

11.  Right-click the **Start** icon to open the context menu, and then select **Windows Terminal (Admin)**.

12.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following two commands, and select Enter after each command:

   ```
ipconfig /flushdns
nslookup www.contoso.com
   ```
13.  Verify that the last command returns the IP address **172.16.0.10**.

### Task 2: Configure DNS policies

1.  Switch to **LON-DC1**, click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

2.  On **LON-DC1**, in the **Windows PowerShell ISE** command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter: 

   ```
   Import-Module DnsServer
   ```

>Note: There's a text file on **LON-DC1** in **E:\Labfiles\Mod04** named **ConfigurePolicies.txt** that has all of the following cmdlets that you can copy and paste into Windows PowerShell.

3.  At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following cmdlets, and select Enter after each cmdlet:

   ```
   Add-DnsServerClientSubnet -Name "UKSubnet" -IPv4Subnet "172.16.0.0/24"
   ```
   ```
   Add-DnsServerClientSubnet -Name "CanadaSubnet" -IPv4Subnet "172.16.18.0/24"
   ```
   ```
   Add-DnsServerZoneScope -ZoneName "Contoso.com" -Name "UKZoneScope"
   ```
   ```
   Add-DnsServerZoneScope -ZoneName "Contoso.com" -Name "CanadaZoneScope"
   ```
   ```
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName "Contoso.com" -A -Name "www" -IPv4Address "172.16.0.41" -ZoneScope "UKZoneScope"
   ```
   ```
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName "Contoso.com" -A -Name "www" -IPv4Address "172.16.18.17" -ZoneScope "CanadaZoneScope"
   ```
   ```
   Add-DnsServerQueryResolutionPolicy -Name "UKPolicy" -Action ALLOW -ClientSubnet "eq,UKSubnet" -ZoneScope "UKZoneScope,1" -ZoneName "Contoso.com"
   ```
   ```
   Add-DnsServerQueryResolutionPolicy -Name "CanadaPolicy" -Action ALLOW -ClientSubnet "eq,CanadaSubnet" -ZoneScope "CanadaZoneScope,1" -ZoneName Contoso.com
   ```

### Task 3: Validate DNS name resolution after configuring DNS policies

1.  Switch to **LON-CL1**.

2.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following two commands, and select Enter after each command:

   ```
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ```
   ```   
   nslookup www.contoso.com
   ```

>Note: You should get the result **172.16.0.41** because LON-CL1 is in the UKZoneScope.

3.  Switch to **TOR-SVR1**.

4.  In the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the cmdlets, and select Enter after each one: 

   ```
   Ipconfig /flushdns
   ```
   ```
   Nslookup www.contoso.com
   ```

>Note: You should get a result of **172.16.18.17** because TOR-SVR1 is in the CanadaZoneScope.

**Results:** After completing this exercise, you'll have configured DNS policies, and then tested that the policies work successfully.

## Exercise 2: Validating the DNS implementation

### Scenario

**LON-CL1** is a laptop device. The user associated with it is traveling to the Sydney office and will use it there for a few months. You must change its network-adapter properties to enable this, and then test to ensure that it works with **SYD-SVR1** as its primary domain controller and DNS server. You'll use **Nslookup** and the Windows PowerShell cmdlets to validate the DNS configuration.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Connect the client to the appropriate virtual local area network (LAN).
2. Use DNS tools to confirm proper client configuration.
3. Test DNS name resolution to external and internal hosts.

### Task 1: Connect the client to the appropriate virtual LAN

1.  Switch to the **LON-CL1** virtual machine.

2.  If necessary, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

3.  On **LON-CL1**, right-click **Start** to open the context menu, and then select **Windows Terminal**.

4.  In the **Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following cmdlet, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Get-DnsClientServerAddress
   ```

>Note: Note that the DNS server address is **172.16.0.10** from the London_Network. This is **LON-DC1**.

5.  On **LON-CL1**, select **Start**, enter **network conn**, and then select **View network Connections**. 

>Note: The **Network Connections** window opens.

6.  In the **Network Connections** window, right-click the **London_Network** connection to open the context menu, and then select **Disable**.

7.  In the **Network Connections** window, right-click the **PAC_WAN** connection to open the context menu, and then select **Enable**. 

>Note: By doing this, you disconnect LON-CL1 from the London network, and then connect it to the PAC_WAN network.

8.  In the **Network Connections** window, right-click the **PAC_WAN** connection to open the context menu, and then select **Properties**.

9.  Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**, and then select **Properties**.

10.  Select **Use the following IP address** and then configure the following:

    - IP address: **`172.16.19.50`**
    - Subnet mask: **`255.255.255.0`**
    - Default gateway: **`172.16.19.1`**

11.  In the **Preferred DNS server** box, enter **`172.16.19.20`**, and then select **OK**.

12.  In the **PAC_WAN Properties** dialog box, select **OK**.

### Task 2: Use DNS tools to confirm proper client configuration

1.  On **LON-CL1**, in Windows PowerShell, enter the following cmdlets, and select Enter after each line:

   ```
   Clear-DnsClientCache
   ```
   ```
   Get-DnsClientServerAddress
   ```

>Note: Note that the DNS server address assigned to PAC_WAN is **172.16.19.20**. This is **SYD-SVR1**.

2.  On **SYD-SVR1**, in **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **DNS**.

3.  In **DNS Manager**, expand **SYD-SVR1**, expand **Forward Lookup Zones**, and then select **Contoso.com**.

4.  In the details pane, examine the **LON-CL1** host record. The IP address should be **172.16.19.50**.

5.  If the address still appears as **172.16.0.50**, perform the following:

   - Switch to **LON-CL1**.

   - On **LON-CL1**, in the **Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following cmdlet, and then select Enter:

     `Register-DnsClient` 

   - Switch to **SYD-SVR1**. In the console tree, right-click **Contoso.com** to open the context menu, and then select **Refresh**.


>Note: The host record for **LON-CL1** should have an IP address of **172.16.19.50**.

6.  In the console tree, right-click **SYD-SVR1** to open the context menu, and then select **Clear Cache**.


### Task 3: Test DNS name resolution to external and internal hosts

1.  On **LON-CL1**, in the **Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following cmdlets, and select Enter after each line:

   ```
   Clear-DnsClientCache
   ```
