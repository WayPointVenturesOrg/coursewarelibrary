# Lab A: Plan and implement DNS name resolution

## Lab scenario

Contoso users in the Sydney location report that connectivity to websites and shared resources is slow and sometimes result in time-out errors. Currently, the Sydney office only contains Windows 11 client computers. Wide area network (WAN) communication between Sydney and London, where infrastructure servers are hosted, has been intermittent and is the primary cause of the issues. You have been asked to implement a Domain Name System (DNS) name-resolution solution in Sydney that'll resolve the majority of these issues.

Contoso's current DNS structure is:

- Contoso's Internet service provider’s (ISP's) DNS server named **INET1** (131.107.0.100) provides DNS resolution and forwarding for internet-based domain names.
- The Adatum.com domain namespace hosts web and mail services that are accessible from the internet and located on the ISP's server named **INET1**. This server is also accessible from inside the Contoso network.
- The Treyresearch.net namespace contains resources used by Contoso employees. However, the DNS records for the Treyresearch.net zone aren't located on the DNS server that clients are configured to use. The Treyresearch.net namespace is located on a DNS server that's installed on **LON-SVR1**.

- **LON-DC1** provides DNS name resolution for the Contoso.com domain.

You need to configure a DNS server in the Sydney location named **SYD-SVR1** to provide efficient name resolution for Sydney clients. The DNS server must resolve queries for local clients, and provide name resolution for the sites Adatum.com and TreyResearch.net. Sydney clients should be forwarded to an authoritative server for Contoso.com to resolve internal domain queries. 

The requirements are as follows:

- Forwarding for all DNS lookups for internet access from Sydney to the ISP’s DNS server.
- Configure conditional forwarding on **SYD-SVR1** for the Contoso.com and Adatum.com zones.
- Host and resolve queries for the Treyresearch.net domain within the Sydney location.

The virtual machines (VMs) used in this lab provide the following services:

- **INET1** (131.107.0.100). DNS server providing name resolution for internet-based DNS names and Adatum.com.
- **EU-RTR** (131.107.0.10, 172.16.0.1, 172.16.18.1) Router for internet, NA_WAN, and PAC_WAN virtual switches.
- **LON-DC1** (172.16.0.10). Domain controller and DNS server hosting the Contoso.com namespace.
- **LON-SVR1** (172.16.0.11). DNS server hosting the Treyresearch.net namespace.
- **SYD-SVR1** (172.16.19.20). The server that you'll configure with DNS to provide name resolution for Sydney's client computers.

## Exercise 2: Implementing DNS servers and zones

### Scenario

You need to install and configure DNS name resolution for the Sydney location according to your DNS implementation plan as follows:

- Install the DNS Server role on **SYD-SVR1**.

- Configure forwarding for internet and external queries to be directed to a DNS server named **INET1** (131.107.0.100).

- Configure conditional forwarding for the Adatum.com domain. All DNS queries for Adatum.com should be directed to **INET1** (131.107.0.100).

- Configure conditional forwarding for the Contoso.com domain. All DNS queries for Contoso.com should be directed to **LON-DC1** (172.16.0.10).

- Configure a secondary zone for the TreyResearch.net domain to be transferred from the DNS server located on **LON-SVR1** (172.16.0.11).
