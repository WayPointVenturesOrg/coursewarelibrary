# Lab A: Implement a Web Application Proxy

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation works with a partner organization that needs access to an internal web application. These external users must not have access to any internal resources except for the specified application. You need to implement and test Web Application Proxy for these users.

## Exercise 1: Implement Web Application Proxy

### Scenario

You need to implement Web Application Proxy to enable external users to access an internal application. You'll use the initial deployment as a proof of concept while the Contoso developers modify the internal application to use Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) claims-based authentication.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Prepare the environment.

2. Configure LON-CL1 as an external client.

3. Install the Web Application Proxy role service.

4. Configure access to an internal website.

### Task 1: Prepare the environment

#### Disable Routing and Remote Access on EU-RTR

1.  Sign in to **EU-RTR** as **Contoso\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  Select the **Start** button, and then select **Server Manager**.

3.  In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Routing and Remote Access**.

4.  In the **Routing and Remote Access** console, in the left pane, right-click **EU-RTR (local)** to open the context menu, and then select **Disable Routing and Remote Access**. 

5.  In the **Routing and Remote Access** dialog box, select **Yes**, and then close the **Routing and Remote Access** window.

>Note: Routing and Remote Access is preconfigured for the purpose of this course's other labs. The Web Application Proxy configuration in this lab won't work properly if you leave Routing and Remote Access enabled on the virtual machine (VM).

### Task 2: Configure LON-CL1 as an external client

#### Remove the client computer from a domain

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  Right-click the **Start** button to open the context  menu, and then select **System**.

3.  In the **System** window, select **Advanced system settings**, and then select the **Computer Name** tab.

8.  To restart the computer, select **OK**.

9.  To close the **System Properties** dialog box, select **Close**.

10.  Select **Restart Now**, and wait for the computer to restart.

#### Import a root CA certificate on the client

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Admin** with the password of **`Pa55w.rd`**.

2.  On the taskbar, select **File Explorer**.
