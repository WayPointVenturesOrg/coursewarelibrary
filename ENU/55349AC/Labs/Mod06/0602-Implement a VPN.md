# Lab B: Implement a VPN

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation has decided to implement a virtual private network (VPN) solution that'll be based on the Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP).

### Prerequisites

You must complete the following lab(s) before beginning this lab:

- 0601-Implement a Web Application Proxy
## Exercise 1: Implement a VPN solution

### Scenario

To implement a VPN solution, you first must verify and configure certificate requirements for the SSTP protocol. You then must configure the Remote Access server to provide VPN connectivity, and create a Remote Access policy to ensure that the clients can connect to the server by using the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and SSTP.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Verify certificate requirements for SSTP.

2. Review the default VPN configuration.

3. Configure the Remote Access policies.

### Task 1: Verify certificate requirements for IKEv2 and SSTP
