# Lab: Provisioning and configuring a Microsoft 365 tenant

## Lab scenario

As part of the proof-of-concept phase, you plan to provision and configure a Microsoft 365 tenant. Your goal for this lab is to provision a new tenant, add additional service subscriptions, and configure organizational settings. You'll also test out the process for installing and configuring integrated apps and Microsoft 365 apps for users.
