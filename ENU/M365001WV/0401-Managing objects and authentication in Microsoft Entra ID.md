# Lab: Managing objects and authentication in Microsoft Entra ID

## Lab scenario

Now that you have a basic understanding of the Microsoft 365 admin center, your next task is to review the features from the perspective of Microsoft Entra ID. You need to identify the process for creating and managing users, groups, and device objects by using the Microsoft Entra admin center. You'll also configure authentication and password requirements, and enable self-service password reset and multifactor authentication (MFA).

>**NOTE:** This lab requires students to first complete the following:
>
>- Module 1 lab: **Provisioning and configuring a Microsoft 365 tenant** 
>- Module 2 lab: **Managing user, resource, and group objects in Microsoft 365**
>
>You'll also need a mobile phone to respond to authentication prompts for some of the lab tasks.
>
>To assist with your sign-in process, enter your Microsoft 365 sign-in username and password as follows:
>
>- **Microsoft 365 Username:**    __________________________________________________________________
>
>- **Password:** **`Pa55w.rd1234`**
